## What is PARA?

For those who are familiar with the whole knowledge management community or the concept of second brain, the PARA method is not a new term. In a nutshell, the PARA method is a way to organize all your documents and presumably "knowledge". Its main idea is to create four folders (five if you count the INBOX folder): Projects, Areas, Resources, and Archives.

- "Projects" is the folder where you put all the active projects, each sub-folder represents a separate project with a clear goal, steps, and the target date.
- "Areas" folder contains all areas of responsibility that needs to be maintained and has an indefinite end date.
- "Resources" folder contains all the data you interested and collected.
- "Archives" folder is the place for anything that is no longer active.

The idea is, whenever you start work on something, you should make it a project, and pull everything that's related to this project into the corresponding project file.
In the meantime, when you collect any external materials, you will put them in the INBOX folder first, and move them into the correct bucket, Projects, Areas, or Resources.

By doing this, you get the benefit that:

1. You don't need to worry about where to put the external materials when collecting them. Just dump them into the INBOX folder.
2. You have a routine that puts all materials in the INBOX folder to a determined location (this varies based on what project you are working on).
3. You gain easy access to all materials needed by your current project, which is the priority you should hyper focus on.

## How PARA helps me?

PARA benefits me a lot especially at my work. As a software engineer, I need to work on multiple projects through milestones. PARA's GTD nature organizes the documents I have,
so that I can focus more on the actual thinking, not memorization. I want to especially mention the handy access that PARA offers.

If you know how computer works, you probably have heard of memory hierarchy and spatial locality. When relevant information is stored and arranged very close by, the computer
can access them faster. That's why the computer loads data from hard disk to the memory, and from the memory to the caches.

Same happens to our brains and document organization too. We want everything we need to be hot in our mind, but due to the brain capacity, it's not always possible, especially when
the topic involves different materials from different parities at different time point. Storing all relevant materials inside of the same folder, the active folder that represents your
active project, is essentially an operation to optimize the spatial locality. This makes it much easier when you need to prepare for a task or pull out a piece of information during the
meeting.

## What PARA is not?

As mentioned above, PARA in the end is a GTD framework. It greatly helps you to complete your tasks faster and better. However, it is not a perfect framework for knowledge management.
It does not emphasize on the format of the materials which is good for easy capturing but bad for long-term maintenance. It also does not focus on linking the knowledge and that makes
it hard to find the hidden gem among your existing notes.

Reading two books at the same time on the same topic can also cause a practical problem. Let's say the two book-reading projects all mention the concept of "Machine Learning", you will likely have
two separate notes in the two different folders about this concept. However, there's no part of the routine will let you somehow merge the same concept in the two different project folders
into one single note. This can be mitigated by extra processing during the archiving but still seems to be a flaw of its GTD core.

## Summary

PARA is a great project management framework. It can be very useful in many ways but its GTD core makes it not the perfect system for knowledge management.
