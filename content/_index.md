## ðŸ‘‹ Hello there, welcome to my page

Iâ€™m a software engineer at Apple, working on RealityKit for iOS and visionOS. I contributed to bringing up the first generation of Apple Vision Pro.

I'm passionate about building technologies that empower human behavior, including simulation, AI, and robotics. With a background in game engines, I love crafting interactive and immersive experiences that bridge the digital and physical worlds. Iâ€™m always exploring new ways to push the boundaries of innovation and human-computer interaction.

Before joining Apple, I earned my Bachelorâ€™s degree in Software Engineering from [Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU)](https://en.sjtu.edu.cn) and my Masterâ€™s degree from the [Carnegie Mellon Entertainment Technology Center (ETC)](https://www.etc.cmu.edu). I also interned at [Uber ATG](https://www.uber.com/us/en/atg/research-and-development/simulation/) as a Simulation Software Engineer.

### Notable Projects

**[Isetta Game Engine](https://isetta.io)** is a C++ open-source project designed to provide junior developers with a practical understanding of game engine architecture. The project documented the development process and rationale behind key design decisions in detail. In addition to the engine itself, we conducted and published interviews with industry professionals, offering valuable insights into the field of game development.
