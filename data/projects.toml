The Isetta Engine project team is demystifying game engine development process for junior developer by making a game engine in C++ and documenting the entire thought & decision-making process. Along the way, we are also conducting interviews with industry professionals, and publishing the edited interview in text on our website.

- Imported low-level 3rd party libraries, including GLFW and Horde3D.
- Implemented core engine libraries, including the math library, the time library and data structures like delegate.
- Implemented the engine loop, level loading, scene graph and the entity component system.
- Implemented high-level gameplay systems, including the event-messaging system and the AI path-finding system.
- Developed a sword fencing game with networking by using Isetta game engine.
- Documented all of my technical desicions and implementation on the website.

- Implemented video generation features individually in Unreal with C++ and Blueprints.
- Integrated the workflow into existing automation process with Python scripts.
- Cooperated with full-time workers and landed the feature through standard development workflow.

Catch'em is a two-player racing game made during Global Game Jam 2018. We broke the theme from 'Transmision' to 'Trans' and 'Mission' and created a game with target switch mechanics. It was one of the most popular game on the demo day, and we won Jammer's Choice award.

- Implemented the game logic with player control and mission switch.
- Implemented infinite terrain generation mechanics.
- Won Jammer's Choice award in Global Game Jam @ Pittsburgh IGDA.

Cyber Arena is a multiplayer VR sword fighting game on Oculus. In this game, each player has a shield and a sword. We integrated the fencing into the game which means the player can only hit specific points to attack the opponent. It also used hit-and-break mechanism to avoid VR sword motion issues. This game is fully competitive with great fun.

- Created the combat system with an Entity-Component oriented design for this game.
- Implemented the visual effects, such as the post-processing effect and the hit blasts.

Scotty3D is a full-featured software package for 3D modeling, rendering, and animation. I implemented these features in the computer graphics course.

- Created a polygon-based modeler with geometry computation and manipulation.
- Implemented a ray-tracing renderer with Monte Carlo methods and global illumination.
- Developed an animator with inverse kinematics and physically-based simulation.

I was creating the procedural world generation system for a voxel game during my internship. This PCG system has more than 50 types of biomes and provides a unlimited space for players to explore. The voxel data was generated by this system and all the art assets were provided by my team.

- Used different combinations of noise functions to create different types of biomes and terrains.
- Optimized the tunnel generation with LOD-like technique.
- Implemented and optimized Wang-Tile plant distribution algorithm for plantation.
