  ðŸ‘‹ Hello there, I'm Chaojie Zhu, currently a software engineer at Apple.
  
  Before Apple, I got my Bachelor degree at [SJTU](https://en.sjtu.edu.cn) (majored in software engineering)
  and my Master degree at [CMU Entertainment Technology Center](https://www.etc.cmu.edu). I interned at
  [Uber ATG](https://www.uber.com/us/en/atg/research-and-development/simulation/) as a simulation software engineer
  and [Xindong Network](https://www.xd.com/?lang=en) as a Unity3D gameplay programmer. 

  I'm mostly interested in using the "nerd power" to help people better interact with technologies thus enhance the quality of life.
  Mostly, my domains of interest are AR/VR, game AI, procedural content generation and tool creation.

  Outside of work, I'm an extensive reader and heavy RPG gamer. I'm currently running [The Wild Beyond The Witchlight](https://dnd.wizards.com/products/wild-beyond-witchlight)
  D&D campaign with my friends and I'm going to DM [Critical Role: Call of the Netherdeep](https://dnd.wizards.com/products/call-netherdeep) in 2022 once it's released.
