  Before Apple, I got my Bachelor degree at [SJTU](https://en.sjtu.edu.cn) (majored in software engineering)
  and my Master degree at [CMU Entertainment Technology Center](https://www.etc.cmu.edu). I interned at
  [Uber ATG](https://www.uber.com/us/en/atg/research-and-development/simulation/) as a simulation software engineer
  and [Xindong Network](https://www.xd.com/?lang=en) as a Unity3D gameplay programmer. 

  I'm mostly interested in using the &#34;nerd power&#34; to help people better interact with technologies thus enhance the quality of life.
  Mostly, my domains of interest are AR/VR, game AI, procedural content generation and tool creation.

  Outside of work, I'm an extensive reader and heavy RPG gamer, previously an Arcane Trickster rogue, currently a Chronurgy wizard named [Christina](https://ddb.ac/characters/64665812/Ku65mz).
